# Getting and Cleaning Data Course - Project
##Project Requirements

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:-

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. The output will be stored into a txt file and upload into our github account.

#####How the run_analysis.R script works
1. Downlod the zip file from data source.
2. Uzip the zip file.
3. Extract the mean and standard deviation measurement and load the data into a seperate dataset.
4. All the dataset will be name with appropritely and descriptive variable names.
5. Merge train dataset.
6. Merge test dataset.
7. Merge train dataset and testdataset.
8. Reshape the merged dataset.
9. Store the results into a text file.
